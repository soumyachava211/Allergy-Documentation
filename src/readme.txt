This folder contains the Python source code for the FHIR Allergy Documentation System.

Files typically include:
- allergy_processing.py: Functions to convert allergy data into FHIR AllergyIntolerance resources.
- validation utilities (optional)
- terminology mapping helpers (optional)

All logic for FHIR resource creation, coding, and preprocessing lives here.
